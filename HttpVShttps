# Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

## 1. What is HTTP?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and follows a client-server model.

### Characteristics of HTTP:
- Uses port **80** by default.
- **Not secure**—data is transmitted in plain text.
- Faster than HTTPS due to the absence of encryption overhead.
- Suitable for **non-sensitive** data transmission.

## 2. What is HTTPS?
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses **SSL/TLS** to encrypt the communication between client and server, ensuring data integrity and security.

### Characteristics of HTTPS:
- Uses port **443** by default.
- **Secure**—encrypts data to prevent interception and attacks.
- Protects against **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks**.
- Used for **secure transactions**, such as online banking and e-commerce.

## 3. Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS
| Feature        | HTTP | HTTPS |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Security      | Not Secure | Secure (Uses SSL/TLS) |
| Port         | 80   | 443   |
| Data Encryption | No  | Yes  |
| Speed        | Faster | Slightly Slower (Due to Encryption) |
| SEO Ranking  | Lower | Higher (Preferred by Search Engines) |
| Use Case     | General websites | Banking, E-commerce, Secure Transactions |

## 4. Example URLs
- **HTTP:** `http://example.com`
- **HTTPS:** `https://example.com`

## 5. Why Use HTTPS?
- Ensures **confidentiality** and **integrity** of data.
- Gains **user trust** with a secure padlock symbol.
- Helps in **SEO ranking** as search engines prioritize HTTPS websites.

## Conclusion
Always prefer **HTTPS** over HTTP, especially for websites dealing with sensitive information. With modern security standards, HTTPS is becoming the default protocol for web communication.
